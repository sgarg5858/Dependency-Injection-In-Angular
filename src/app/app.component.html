<h2>
  We implemented @Host() Resolution Modifier Decorator, which looks till the host element
  If we commnent the provider from top component it will throw error, as Top is the last Host
  element for bottom component.

  By default current component is host component, but when we project that component inside
  parent component , parent component becomes host component
